Any data that needs to be persisted must be stored externally (e.g., in Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL). | **Kubernetes Pod:** The smallest deployable unit of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes. A Pod represents a running process on your cluster and can contain one or more containers. |\n| **Pricing/Availability** | **Pay-per-use:** You are billed for the CPU, memory, and requests your container uses when it's active. Always available as a fully managed service. | **Pay for nodes and control plane:** You pay for the underlying compute instances (nodes) that run your containers and a small fee for the CE control plane. Highly available with various cluster configurations. |\n\n---\n\n## Winner: Beginner vs. Enterprise\n\n**For a Beginner:** **Cloud Run** is the clear winner. Its serverless nature, automatic scaling, and focus on stateless containers abstract away the complexities of infrastructure management. A beginner can deploy a containerized application and have it running and scaling without needing to understand Kubernetes concepts like nodes, pods, or deployments.\n\n**For an Enterprise User:** **CE** is the superior choice. The advanced control, flexibility, and powerful orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes are essential for managing complex, mission-critical enterprise applications. CE allows for fine-grained customization of networking, security, storage, and resource allocation, which are crucial for large-scale deployments and adhering to strict compliance requirements. While Cloud Run can handle many scenarios, CE offers the depth and breadth of features required for truly enterprise-grade container orchestration."
